            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

With a ſhort Catologue of ſome of the fighting Prieſts, And for juſt cauſe given, have given them a blow in one of their eyes, (pickt out of the whores head) which they call, A Fountain of Religion, but is a ſink of iniquity.</p>
            <p>Alſo a word to thoſe old Creatures who are old in iniquity, and in the fallen eſtate, yet deny falling away.</p>
            <p>Likewiſe a word to thoſe Magiſtrates and Rulers who whip, or ſuffer to be whipt or impriſoned the Saints of the moſt High as Vagabonds, amongſt whom there is no Begger.</p>
            <p>As alſo a word to that bad Generation of people, who in their reprobate minds, and with their unwholſome tongues blaſpheme and belye the dreadful and juſt God, in ſaying that he hath created ſome men intentionally to be damned, and a particular number to be ſaved and damn'd. Wherefore then doth the Hireling preach, and for what hath he his hire? Mark, the decrees of God are yea, <hi>Amen,</hi> and unalterable.</p>
            <p>A word to theſe who are called Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts, Lords, Barrons, Bannerets, Baronets, Knights of all ſorts, Eſquires and Gentlemen (ſo called.)</p>
            <p>Alſo let that Generation that deſire a ſigne, read ſome of the Examples that have befallen the Perſecutors of the Innocent.</p>
            <p>By a lover of good Men, good Laws, good Governments and Governours, good Judges and Miniſters, as at the beginning: Who hates nor fears no man, and is a lover and honourer of all men in the Lord, but cannot give flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Titles, or reſpect the perſon of any man. <hi>E.

            <p>I Do believe that very many among you are not unſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of your own unfruitfulneſſe, and unfaithful dealing to God-ward; and I know that ye may not deny, but if ye had ſtood in your former integrity, that is to ſay, when ye were little in your own eyes, when compaſſion was no ſtranger, and tenderneſſe was well known amongſt ye, then was the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and all his <hi>Jewiſh,</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> trumpery ſentenced, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience vowed; I ſay if ye had ſtood in that integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ye might have been inſtrumental to have ſaved much of the innocent blood that hath been ſhed, for which I know the Lords hand will be ſpeedily and eminently revealed upon ſome amongſt ye, who have connived at cruel murthers, when as the blood of the innocent hath been laid before ye; as <hi>James Parnels</hi> in the firſt place was; but ſince him many others have drank of the ſame cup, even to death; And I am ſure the Lord will rebuke princes for our ſakes, and let the moſt ſturdieſt oak amongſt ye know that the indignation and fierce wrath of the dreadful God is kindled, and his righteous judgement is nigh, even at the door, and a ſudain and terrible breach will he make amongſt ye, at unawares, when ye look not for his coming; for verily his righteous ſpirit is grieved at the cruelties that are done, &amp; although ye hedge your ſelves up with many ſpears and think to ſurround your ſelves with battleaxes, yet the ſame ſpirit, which ye have many of ye like fools gone about to limit,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:40242:3"/> will ſuddainly break through all your contrivances, and a day of mourning will overtake ye, although for the preſent ye are not troubled like other men; but ſuffer the Prophets, and meſſengers of the living God to be ſlain before your faces; yea I know the righteous have periſhed, and none of ye have laid it to heart, ſo as to remedy it, and if any of them be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of the Lord to come among you, ſome of ye have even ſhamefully and cruelly entreated them, madly reſiſting the holy One in his way; but let the moſt ſurlieſt among ye know that the blood of the innocent hath reached heaven, and he will not ſpare ye.</p>
            <p>And now that none of ye from the General to the meaneſt ſentinel may be ignorant what innocent blood I mean; It is the blood of ſuch who did believe, and declare that Chriſt is come in the fleſh, and ſo durſt not uphold a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or <hi>Popiſh</hi> prieſt-hood by paying of them tythes; and ſome for going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Maſs-houſe, and deſiring the hireling to fear the Lord, and turn from the evil of his wayes, or asking a ſober queſtion, and for not ſwearing, which is the breach of an eſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Chriſt, who ſayes <hi>ſwear not at all;</hi> many others drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged out of their peaceable meetings, without the breach of the leaſt Popiſh law whatſoever, and thrown into dungeons, and naſty holes, amongſt theeves and murtherers; other being upon their knees at prayer, have been taken up by the hair of the head, &amp; ſome thrown into priſon without ſo much as a <hi>Mittimus,</hi> &amp; there kept for many moneths; others have been ſtoned, knockt down with clubs and ſtones, mangled with ſwords, and run into the body, and abundance of ſuch cruelties I might name, beſides the exceeding great number of our friends that have been whipt as vagabonds, and committed to priſon for vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds, and yet, be it known to the whole World, we have not a begger amongſt us.</p>
            <p>One and the ſame woman hath been committed for not coming, and coming to the Steeple-houſe, although ſhe ſpake not a word to either Prieſt or people; others have been invited by the Magiſtrates in my hearing to the Steeple-houſe to have a diſpute, and yet afterwards was committed to priſon, but the cauſe of the innocont which of ye have pleaded? or what Juſtice hath there been done to the poor <hi>Nazarenes?</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:40242:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> when any of us have been falſly, and contrary to all manner of Law, impriſoned for the ſpace of a year more or leſſe, there is ſome would have us call it a favour, when as for ſhame they are forced to deliver us.</p>
            <p>When ſome of the Lambs of God have been <hi>brought to the bar, the Judge hath</hi> asked the plaintiff, what he had againſt the Priſoner, he anſwered, <hi>he abuſed me, he abuſed me;</hi> wherein? why ſaid the plaintiff, he bid me fear the Lord, and this he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led an abuſe; and many ſuch rediculous abſurdities I might name, that hath been committed by the Anti-chriſtian Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Clergy, and thoſe upon whom that beaſt rides, in theſe our yet bad-reformed times; but I ſhall wade further into that Sea anon.</p>
            <p>Friends, It is not unknown to me, the exceeding largeneſs of your borders in the earth and your being at much eaſe in the fleſh, having more then heart can wiſh, many of ye not having the leaſt ſympathy with <hi>Jacobs</hi> troubles, being as ye think ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrapt up in fig-leaves, having on a phylactary of the beſt make, yet the dreadful God of hoſts will fall in among ye at unawares on every hand, if ye ſpeedily repent not, and lay to heart the ſufferings of the innocent, and forthwith relieve the oppreſſed, your latter end will be worſe then your beginning; where is that ſpirit of tenderneſſe that was once among ye, that dearly loved mercy and juſtice? have ye turned the love of God backwards? Oh! ye have given him juſt cauſe utterly to forſake ye; have ye ſold your ſelves to do wickedly? and inſtead of growing from ſtrength to ſtrength, and from grace to grace, ye have turned the grace of God into wantonneſſe and oppreſſion, ſwearing, and for ſwearing, vowing and not performing, all which the Lord our God hates; and let not the moſt lofty Ceader of ye all be deceived, the Lords arm is not ſhortned, and aſuredly he will viſit for theſe things.</p>
            <p>What, hath victories, treaſures and ſpoyls ſo puffed ye up, that ye quite forget your ſelves, &amp; your poor brethren? and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye have overcome the oppreſſors, do ye therefore op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe? but the ſame Lord lives as ever, and thats our aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, that he will make all his enemies his foot-ſtool (appeaſe that in your ſelves which would be angry) and honeſtly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if ye do not uphold the enemies of God, and Gods people
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:40242:4"/> at this day, yea I know there was a ſpirit amongſt ye once, that would have grieved in your very hearts, and have thought it your <hi>very</hi> ſhame, that the people of God ſhould have lain rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Goals even to death for not ſwearing, or putting off a hat, and for not putting into the hirelings mouth, which ye all may, and I do believe for the moſt part do know that he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven your own implacable enemy; do not all go along with them like fools to the ſtocks, till a dart ſtrikes ſheer through your li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers? I ſay there was a time when the hireling and his <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Popiſh</hi> trumpery was all ſentenced, and the brand of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querer, and other Tyranies vowed to be taken off, but ye are for-ſworn, and the Lord will not hold them guiltleſſe, that have ſo often called God to witneſſe, and not performed, as ſome of ye have done, although you may ſay in your hearts, he defers his coming; &amp; becauſe judgement is not ſpeedily execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, therefore the wicked are ſet in their heart to do evil; and my friends, I am ſure the blood of the innocent ſhall never ceaſe to cry, till ſuch time that the ſeed of God be delivered, and fully diſcharged from their deadly priſons, and naſty holes, where many of the moſt pretious Saints of the Lord are thronged, where ſome already have ſealed their Teſtimony with their blood, and ſeveral others are languiſhing even at the brink of death; and all this, and much more is ſuffered to gratifie the hireling that irreclameable relique of popery.</p>
            <p>May not all that are wiſe in heart plainly ſee that the Prieſts of this Land war with fleſh and blood, and for principalities, and powers, and their weapons are indeed carnal, and not ſpiritual, who no longer then their mouths are cramed and filled, they prepare war, and murders men for their bellies, and have had the blood of ſeveral already? Oh cruel gluttony, and moſt accurſed appetite, that nothing can ſtanch or ſatisfie but blood! Oh, let them have blood to drink, and let the whores cup be filled brim full with the indignation and dregs of the wrath of the Almighty God. If we were the wolves, as the hirelings ſayes we are, and they the ſheep or Lambs, I am ſure all people will confeſſe with me, that it is not the nature of ſheep and Lambs to devour and kill the wolves, but the wolves did of old, as theſe do now, kill the ſheep, and devour the innocent Lambs.</p>
            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:40242:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p>I have read and doe believe that the good Shepherd laid down his own life for the Sheep, but I do not read that he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver took away the life of any. So my dear Friends, honeſtly conſider who ye are for, and who ye uphold; for verily, if ye lay down your lives and periſh for and with their deceipt, I am bold in the Lord God to declare it unto you all, from the higheſt to the loweſt, that they are falling, and mine eye ſees it; and it is impoſſible for ye to defend or ſecure them from the juſt name of Antichriſts falſe prophets, deceivers, greedy dumb dogs, who can never have enough, but ſtill ſeeks for his gain from his quarter; (mark that, he ſeeks it) as the falſe Prophets did of old; for there is few or none that are not forced, yea very few that brings his gain to him, but himſelf, or ſome one for him ſeeks all the quarters of the field till he finds the poor brow-ſweating husband-man (who eats the bread of carefulneſſe all the year long) no ſooner he finds him, or his corn or hay, but he preſently tels out the tenth ſheaf, or tenth Cock, and ſo ſets his thiefs mark upon it, and calls it his own. Compare him to the falſe prophet, which is ſpoken of in <hi>Mich.</hi> 3. read the whole Chapter, and ſee if there be any more diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence then there is betwixt a thief and a ravenous Lawyer, or a Judge, whoſe hands and affections may be full of bribery, and yet hangs a thief. Friends, lay aſide prejudice, and honeſtly Judge.</p>
            <p>Ye may remember that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaid, a Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up like unto me, him ſhall ye hear in all things (mark, and truly conſider the word <hi>all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi>) he doth not ſay, him ſhall ye hear in ſome things onely, but him ſhall ye hear in <hi>all</hi> things; and it comes to paſs, that he that will not hear this Prophet, ſhall be cut off.

So ſuffers the ſervants of the living God at this day, and as they have done unto me, ſo will they do unto ye, ſaith Chriſt; The ſervant is not greater then his Lord; and he that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecution.</p>
            <p>And all this was done to them of old, as is to us at this day, even by the ſame Generation of high-prieſts, high in profeſſion, and ſpoke as big ſwelling words, and made as much ado about their New Moons, Sabbath-dayes, Tithes, Temple, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, Bull, Goat, Ram and heifer; all which were but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of good things to come; as the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> do about their Maſſe-houſe, Gleab-land, Tithe-ſheaf, Lamb, Calfe, Wooll, Gooſe, Pig, Mortuary, Peter-pence, Bread, Wine, and Baby-baptiſm; but as they did, theſe do now hate the Light, but it was, and is becauſe their deeds were and theſe are evil, and did as theſe do now, deney to hear the prophet in <hi>all</hi>

            <p>Can that be the Miniſtry of Chriſt that murthers men for their bellies?

            <p>And yet if any be moved of the Lord to tell any one of theſe cruel men that their glory is their ſhame, or their belly is their God, its much if ſome Prieſt-ridden Juſtice or another do not ſend him to the Goal for it.</p>

            <p>By this let the ſimple-hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted compare and infer, &amp;c. Now my <hi>belief</hi> is, that if the Prieſts of <hi>England have</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, and <hi>will</hi> freely give, and not exact, torture and murther the innocent for their bellies, nor be burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to no man, but <hi>freely give,</hi> and <hi>freely</hi> receive, &amp; he which preaches the Goſpel to live up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, I do believe in my very heart God will be very well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Prieſt, try him and truſt in him, and do not take the benefit of a bad Law which thou haſt procured by thy ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous implacability; For verily it quite lames thee, and all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable men ſee thee, and the feeble inſufficiency of thy Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel which can neither <hi>ſtand,</hi> nor procure thee meat for thybel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, without the help of an outward Law and Sword, which is onely to protect mens perſons, and not to ſuffer a cruel man to take away from a poor man, and a faithful denizen of the ſame Nation, a hundred pounds for a hundred ſhillings.</p>
            <p>So do not cover thy ſelf under the Magiſtrate, and ſneak to them, and make him or them the abſolute Author of thy wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs; but leave off thy filthineſs, and let him that hath ſtollen, ſteal no more, but rather reſtore, and learn to labour with thy own hands, and the labourer is worthy of his hire, and the work-man of his meat, and I am freely content that he which hireth any man ſhould be forced to pay him his wages; but I am ſure it is not in the leaſt equal amongſt men,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:40242:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> for me to pay another mans work-man, although <hi>all</hi> the work he doth may ſeemingly be logically or ſyllogiſtically true.

            <p>And if for this my Teſtimony againſt the hireling, which I ſtill ſay, could not ſtand, nor have a being as a mercenary hireling, if it were not for the Sword; I ſay, if for this my Teſtimony my life be called for, I may not ſay, I matter it; for my Redeemer lives, and I know for this very end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe hath he raiſed me up, even to bear my Teſtimony with my life to the death, againſt the falſe-hired Antichriſt of this Nation, even to the Gates of <hi>Rome</hi> his Original, and very late Anteceſſor. And this am I truly bold in the Lord to declare without fear, what is poſſible to be done againſt me, by them or their adherents, although I know they are the onely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parers of War againſt the innocent.</p>

            <p>IN ſtead of executing, and making juſt Lawes which ſhould reach that of God in every mans conſcience, and be a hook in the noſe of the evil doer, and break the jawes of the wicked, I ſay, in ſtead of that ye break the hearts of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, many of ye, by exerciſing onely your own wills; others by
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:40242:30"/> ſtraining the too many grievous acts, and cruel Edicts lately made, by vertue whereof, together with your inſolency, and tyranical wills, ye ſnatch up the people of God, as they travel up and down about their lawful occaſions, and this is common with ſome of ye to do; when the man is not above ten, fifteen, or twenty miles from his outward home, nor out of the ſame County, wherein he, or they were born; going to, coming from, or being in a meeting with the Lords people.</p>
            <p>The inferiour Magiſtrate, who for the moſt part are made drunk with rage, and the zeal-drunk Proſolytes who lie in wait as a Troop of evil-doers in every corner, hales the friend of the Lord before that Magiſtrate and if he be good for no other thing, he'l ſerve to ſwear, and to bear falſe witneſs for the Beaſt, and againſt the innocent; and to cauſe him to be whipped for a Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bond, and committed to a bad priſon among thieves and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers, under whoſe commitment, and cruel uſages ſeveral of the precious Lambs and ſervants of the Lord, have laid down the outward man, and finiſhed their teſtimony with their blood.
